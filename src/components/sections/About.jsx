        <p>The tech industry always offers us new challenging paths to explore, and that's what I love about it. I am currently specialized in full stack web applications, but I am really curious about development in general. I enjoy stimulating my creativity and then thinking about the best and simple way to bring my ideas to the final users, and always try to push the projects further within a passionate team.</p>
